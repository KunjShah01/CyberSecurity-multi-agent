## 3. Getting Started

### Onboarding Tips for Beginners
- If you are new to Python, start with [Python Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- If you are new to Docker, see [Docker Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
- If you are new to Git, try [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/)
- Donâ€™t hesitate to Google errors or ask for help!

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended)
- Git
- Basic command line knowledge

### Setup (Docker Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-multi-agent.git
cd security-multi-agent

# Copy and edit environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and settings

# Start the stack
docker-compose up -d
```

### Local Python Setup
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python controller_agent.py
```

> **Beginner Tip:** If you get stuck, Google the error message or ask for help on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), or open an issue on GitHub.

---

## 4. Configuration

> **Beginner Tip:** Never share your `.env` file or API keys publicly!

- All configuration is managed via `.env` and `config.yaml`.
- Sensitive keys (API, DB, JWT) must be kept secret.
- Example `.env` and `config.yaml` files are provided.

**.env Example:**
```
VT_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=your_abuseipdb_api_key
IPINFO_TOKEN=your_ipinfo_token
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

---

## 5. Core Concepts

> **Glossary:**
> - **Agent**: A mini-program that does a specific security job.
> - **Controller Agent**: The boss that tells other agents what to do.
> - **A2A Protocol**: The way agents talk to each other.
> - **API**: Lets other programs talk to this system.
> - **Dashboard**: The web app you use to control everything.

- **Agent**: A modular, independent component that performs a specific security function.
- **Controller Agent**: Orchestrates the workflow and communication between agents.
- **A2A Protocol**: Secure, structured messaging between agents.
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for automation and integration.
- **Dashboard**: Web UI for interactive use and visualization.

---

## 6. Agent Architecture

> **Pro Tip:** Use Python classes for agents to keep your code organized and testable.

**Beginner Example:**
```python
class HelloWorldAgent:
    def run(self, input_data):
        return {"message": "Hello, world!"}
```

**Advanced Tip:**
- Use Pythonâ€™s `async` and `await` for high-performance agents
- Use dependency injection for testability

Each agent is a Python module/class with a clear interface:
- `run()` or `analyze()` method as entry point
- Receives structured input (dict or dataclass)
- Returns structured output (dict or dataclass)
- Can be run independently for testing

**Example Agent Skeleton:**
```python
class ExampleAgent:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
    def run(self, input_data):
        # ...logic...
        return {"result": "ok"}
```

---

## 7. Developing New Agents

> **Beginner Tip:** Start by copying an existing agent folder and modifying it.
> **Advanced:** Use dependency injection and type hints for more robust code.

**Beginner Steps:**
- Copy an existing agent folder and rename it
- Change the logic in the `run()` method
- Test it by calling it directly in a Python shell

**Advanced Steps:**
- Add configuration options and error handling
- Write unit and integration tests
- Document your agent with docstrings and comments

1. **Create a new folder** in `agents/` (e.g., `agents/my_agent/`).
2. **Implement your agent** as a Python class/module.
3. **Define a clear interface** (`run()` or `analyze()` method).
4. **Add configuration options** if needed.
5. **Write tests** in `tests/`.
6. **Register your agent** in `controller_agent.py`.
7. **Document your agent** in the code and README.

**Agent Template:**
```python
class MyAgent:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
    def run(self, input_data):
        # Your logic here
        return {"output": "result"}
```

---

## 8. API Development

> **Pro Tip:** Use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) models for data validation.

**Beginner Tip:**
- Use [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8000/docs) to try API endpoints without writing code

**Advanced Tip:**
- Use FastAPI dependencies for authentication, rate limiting, etc.
- Add OpenAPI documentation for new endpoints

- The backend uses FastAPI (`fastapi_app/`).
- Endpoints are defined in `main.py`.
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation.
- Add new endpoints for new agent features as needed.

**Example Endpoint:**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
from pydantic import BaseModel

router = APIRouter()

class ScanRequest(BaseModel):
    query: str
    scan_type: str

@router.post("/scan")
def scan(request: ScanRequest):
    # Call controller agent
    return {"result": "scan started"}
```

---

## 9. Web Dashboard

> **Beginner Tip:** Streamlit lets you build UIs with just a few lines of Python.

**Advanced Tip:**
- Use session state for multi-step workflows
- Integrate real-time updates with WebSockets

- Built with Streamlit (`dashboard/app.py`).
- Use widgets for user input and display results.
- Integrate new agent features by adding new UI components.

**Example Streamlit Widget:**
```python
import streamlit as st
st.title("Security Multi-Agent Dashboard")
query = st.text_input("Enter IP, domain, or email:")
if st.button("Scan"):
    # Call backend API
    st.write("Scan started!")
```

---

## 10. Testing & Quality

> **Beginner Tip:** Run `pytest` after every change to catch bugs early.
> **Advanced:** Set up CI/CD to automate tests on every pull request.

**Beginner Tip:**
- Run `pytest` and look for green (pass) or red (fail)
- Start with simple tests: check if your agent returns the right output

**Advanced Tip:**
- Use fixtures and mocks for complex tests
- Integrate tests with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, etc.)

- Use `pytest` for all tests.
- Place tests in `tests/` directory.
- Aim for high coverage (unit, integration, API tests).
- Use `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, and `bandit` for code quality and security.

**Run Tests:**
```bash
pytest
pytest --cov=agents --cov-report=html
```

---

## 11. Debugging & Troubleshooting

> **Beginner Tip:** Use `print()` to see what's happening in your code.
> **Advanced:** Use Python's `logging` module for more control and log levels.

**Beginner Tip:**
- Use `print()` to see what your code is doing
- Check logs in the terminal or with `docker-compose logs`

**Advanced Tip:**
- Use Pythonâ€™s `logging` module for structured logs
- Use a debugger (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) to step through code

- Use `docker-compose logs` or `docker logs` for container output.
- Use `print()` or logging for debugging Python code.
- For API debugging, use tools like Postman or curl.
- Check `.env` and config for misconfigurations.
- Use `pytest -s` for verbose test output.

---

## 12. Security Best Practices

> **Pro Tip:** Use tools like [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) and [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/) to scan for vulnerabilities.

**Beginner Tip:**
- Never post your `.env` file or secrets online
- Always use strong, unique passwords

**Advanced Tip:**
- Use Docker secrets or Vault for production secrets
- Set up automated vulnerability scanning (Trivy, Bandit, etc.)
- Enforce least privilege for all agents and services

- Never commit secrets or API keys to git.
- Use non-root users in Docker containers.
- Keep dependencies up to date.
- Run security scans (`bandit`, `trivy`, etc.) regularly.
- Use HTTPS and secure headers in production.
- Rotate keys and passwords regularly.

---

## 13. Deployment

> **Beginner Tip:** Always test locally before deploying to production.
> **Advanced:** Use environment-specific configs and secrets managers for production.

**Beginner Tip:**
- Use Docker Compose for easy local deployment
- Always test in development before deploying to production

**Advanced Tip:**
- Use environment-specific configs for dev, staging, and prod
- Set up monitoring and alerting for production deployments

- **Production**: Use `docker-compose.yml` with secure environment variables.
- **Development**: Use `docker-compose.dev.yml` for live reload and debugging.
- **Cloud**: Can be deployed to AWS, GCP, Azure, or any Docker-compatible host.
- **Backup**: Regularly backup database and configuration files.
